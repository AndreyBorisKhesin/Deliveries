Each truck can hold 50 heaters or 25 air conditioners.
So H + 2AC cannot exceed 50.

P1 is the air conditioner because P2 is a heater based on purchases in summer
and winter months.

An average of the sales of a given product on a given day of the week showed
that there is no difference between sales by day of the week.
In terms of standard deviation, the highest was 1.88502, which is outside of
the middle 0.940573 events, but p > 0.05 so we are forced to reject the
hypothesis that noticably fewer air conditioners are sold on Friday than on
any other day.

We can, however, clearly see that an average of 7.82856 air conditioners are
sold every day, compared to only 4.47898 heaters.
